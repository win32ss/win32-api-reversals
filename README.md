# win32-api-reversals
Windows API function reversals from post-Server 2003 RTM.

Reverse engineered Windows API functions introduced after Server 2003 RTM or alternative implementations that provide additional flexibillity not provided by 
MS implementations (such as GetVersionEx), or adapt to differences in underlying kernel mode capability (for example: processor group-related functions on pre-Windows 7 OSes).
